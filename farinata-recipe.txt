http://memoriediangelina.com/2013/06/23/farinata-genovese-genovese-chickpea-flatbread/

Ingredients:
- 250g (1/2 lb) of chickpea flour (see Notes)
- 800ml (27 oz) water
- Salt
- A good pour of olive oil

Optional flavorings:
- Freshly ground pepper
- Fresh rosemary leaves
- Thinly sliced spring onions

Directions:

1.Place the flour and salt in a large bowl, then slowly whisk in the water until  you have perfectly smooth, rather thin batter, similar to a crepe batter. Let the batter rest for at least three hours or (better) overnight. When you are ready to make your farinata, mix in the oil.

2. Now pour the batter into a greased baking sheet. It should just cover the bottom by no more than 2 or 3 cm (1/2 inch) at most, thinner if you like. Sprinkle one of more of the optional flavorings, if you like.

3. Bake the batter in a hot oven (200C/400F) for about 15-2o minutes, or until golden brown on top. Cut into serving pieces and serve hot.
